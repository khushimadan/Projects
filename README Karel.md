KAREL'S TRIP TO INDIA

Karel is a robot created by an alumni of Stanford University which is now used by the professors as a fun way to teach programming. During the first 2 weeks of Code In Place we were taught how to program in Python using Karel. I created this project where in Karel visits India for the first time. Karel travels the northern part of India first where it visits the hills and then it travels through the southern part of India visiting various temples. It picks up every beeper that comes along its way. While travelling, it paints every corner of the Karel's World (10x10 grid) a color from the Indian Flag (Orange, White, Green and Blue symbolising the Ashoka Chakra).
