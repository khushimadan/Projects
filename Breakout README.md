BREAKOUT

Created the classic Atari Breakout game using graphics and animation. Basic rules of the game- Move your cursor to move the paddle. Make the ball fall on the paddle so it bounces off and hits the bricks. Hit all the bricks in order to win the game. You get 3 lives. Game gets over when the ball hits the bottom boundary 3 times.
